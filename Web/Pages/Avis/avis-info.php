                Essay
              As the corpse went past the flies left the restaurant table in a cloud
              and rushed after it, but they came back a few minutes later.

              The little crowd of mourners-all men and boys, no women--threaded
              their way across the market-place between the piles of pomegranates
              and the taxis and the camels, wailing a short chant over and over
              again. What really appeals to the flies is that the corpses here
              are never put into coffins, they are merely wrapped in a piece of
              rag and carried on a rough wooden bier on the shoulders of four friends.
              When the friends get to the burying-ground they hack an oblong hole a
              foot or two deep, dump the body in it and fling over it a little of the
              dried-up, lumpy earth, which is like broken brick. No gravestone, no
              name, no identifying mark of any kind. The burying-ground is merely a
              huge waste of hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot. After a month
              or two no one can even be certain where his own relatives are buried.

              When you walk through a town like this--two hundred thousand inhabitants,
              of whom at least twenty thousand own literally nothing except the rags
              they stand up in--when you see how the people live, and still more how
              easily they die, it is always difficult to believe that you are walking
              among human beings. All colonial empires are in reality founded upon
              that fact. The people have brown faces--besides, there are so many of
              them! Are they really the same flesh as yourself? Do they even have
              names? Or are they merely a kind of undifferentiated brown stuff, about
              as individual as bees or coral insects? They rise out of the earth, they
              sweat and starve for a few years, and then they sink back into the
              nameless mounds of the graveyard and nobody notices that they are gone.
              And even the graves themselves soon fade back into the soil. Sometimes,
              out for a walk, as you break your way through the prickly pear, you
              notice that it is rather bumpy underfoot, and only a certain regularity
              in the bumps tells you that you are walking over skeletons.
